# Employee Data Tracker

## Description
My motivation in creating this file generator is to expand my knowledge with using SQL.
I built this project to assist in making and editing a database of employee data.
This will make it easy to see and edit who is on your team and all of their info in one place.
I learned how to use MySql to help further my coding abilities.
